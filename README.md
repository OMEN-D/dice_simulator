# dice_simulator
A basic dice-simulator that randomly generates different combination.

I have created a simple GUI via tkinter which you can interact with button to use dice-simulations. 
I have used PIL module for images install it using 'pip install pillow'. All the images are from images directory.

I know it doesn't look great but it is what it is :)
